# nand2tetris_vm_translator
My implementation of the Virtual Machine Translator as described in the course Nand2Tetris II. 

The VM Translator is essential to realising the two-tier compilation architecture of the Jack programming language down to Hack assembly.

Both part one and part two of Nand2Tetris have been challenging and fun, I'd highly recommend it for anyone wanting
to see beneath the "black box" that is a computer.
